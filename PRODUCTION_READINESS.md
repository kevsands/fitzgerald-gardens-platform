## Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: Staging Deployment
```bash
# 1. Create staging environment
npm run deploy:staging

# 2. Run smoke tests
npm run test:e2e

# 3. Perform manual QA
```

### Phase 2: Production Deployment
```bash
# 1. Final checks
npm run preflight

# 2. Deploy to production
npm run deploy:production

# 3. Monitor deployment
npm run monitor
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Rollback Plan
1. Keep previous version tagged
2. Database backup before migration
3. Feature flags for new functionality
4. Blue-green deployment ready

### Monitoring Alerts
- CPU usage > 80%
- Memory usage > 85%
- Error rate > 1%
- Response time > 2s
- Failed authentications > 10/min
