- **Key Needs**: Sales funnel, buyer management, construction tracking, revenue optimization
- **Data Flow**: Projects → Units → Pricing → Availability → Customizations → Handover

### 3. Solicitors
- **Journey**: Onboard → Review → Process → Complete → Archive
- **Key Needs**: Document exchange, deadline tracking, multi-party coordination
- **Data Flow**: Contracts → Searches → Amendments → Signatures → Completions

### 4. Financial Institutions
- **Journey**: Application → Assessment → Approval → Drawdown → Monitoring
- **Key Needs**: Risk assessment, document verification, fund management
- **Data Flow**: Applications → Creditworthiness → Approvals → Disbursements

### 5. Government (HTB)
- **Journey**: Eligibility → Application → Approval → Disbursement → Compliance
- **Key Needs**: Compliance verification, fund tracking, reporting
- **Data Flow**: Eligibility → Applications → Approvals → Claims → Audits

## Integration Points

### 1. Property Marketplace
```typescript
interface PropertyListing {
  developer: DeveloperProfile;
  unit: UnitDetails;
  availability: AvailabilityStatus;
  pricing: PricingStructure;
  customizations: CustomizationOptions;
  documents: MarketingDocuments;
}
```

**Synchronization Requirements:**
- Real-time availability updates
- Pricing changes propagation
- Customization options per unit
- Document version control

### 2. Buyer Journey Integration

```typescript
interface BuyerTransaction {
  buyer: BuyerProfile;
  property: PropertySelection;
  financing: FinancingDetails;
  customizations: SelectedCustomizations;
  legalProcess: LegalWorkflow;
  timeline: TransactionTimeline;
}
```

**Key Integrations:**
- Developer inventory → Buyer selection
- Buyer profile → HTB eligibility
- Financing approval → Reservation confirmation
- Customization choices → Developer build specs
- Legal milestones → All party notifications

### 3. Document Workflow

```typescript
interface DocumentWorkflow {
  parties: StakeholderParties[];
  documents: Document[];
  signatures: SignatureRequirements[];
  timeline: DocumentTimeline;
  notifications: NotificationRules[];
}
```

**Document Types & Routing:**
1. **Marketing Materials**: Developer → Buyer
2. **Reservation Agreement**: Developer ↔ Buyer ↔ Solicitors
3. **Sales Contract**: Developer ↔ Buyer (via Solicitors)
4. **HTB Application**: Buyer → Government → Developer
5. **Mortgage Docs**: Buyer ↔ Bank ↔ Solicitor
6. **Completion Docs**: All parties

### 4. Financial Flows

```typescript
interface FinancialTransaction {
  type: TransactionType;
  parties: FinancialParties[];
  amount: MoneyAmount;
  timing: PaymentSchedule;
  conditions: PaymentConditions[];
  tracking: AuditTrail;
}
```

**Money Movement:**
1. **Booking Deposit**: Buyer → Developer (via escrow)
2. **HTB Fund**: Government → Developer (on milestone)
3. **Mortgage**: Bank → Solicitor → Developer
4. **Balance**: Buyer → Solicitor → Developer
5. **Customization**: Buyer → Developer (staged)

### 5. Communication Hub

```typescript
interface CommunicationMatrix {
  channels: CommunicationChannel[];
  participants: Stakeholder[];
  topics: MessageCategory[];
  routing: RoutingRules[];
  escalation: EscalationPath[];
}
```

**Communication Flows:**
- Automated updates (status changes)
- Action requests (document signing)
- Queries (buyer → developer)
- Notifications (milestone reached)
- Alerts (deadline approaching)

## Synchronization Architecture

### Event-Driven Updates
```typescript
enum SystemEvent {
  PROPERTY_LISTED,
  BUYER_REGISTERED,
  VIEWING_SCHEDULED,
  OFFER_MADE,
  RESERVATION_CONFIRMED,
  CUSTOMIZATION_SELECTED,
  HTB_APPROVED,
  MORTGAGE_APPROVED,
  CONTRACT_SIGNED,
  PAYMENT_RECEIVED,
  CONSTRUCTION_UPDATE,
  COMPLETION_SCHEDULED,
  KEYS_HANDED_OVER
}

interface EventHandler {
  event: SystemEvent;
  handlers: StakeholderHandler[];
  notifications: NotificationRule[];
  stateUpdates: StateTransition[];
}
```

### Data Consistency

1. **Master Data Sources:**
   - Properties: Developer system
   - Buyers: CRM system
   - Transactions: Platform database
   - Documents: Document management system
   - Payments: Financial ledger

2. **Sync Mechanisms:**
   - Real-time APIs for critical updates
   - Webhooks for state changes
   - Scheduled sync for bulk updates
   - Event streaming for audit trail

### Security & Permissions

```typescript
interface AccessControl {
  stakeholder: StakeholderType;
  resource: ResourceType;
  permissions: Permission[];
  conditions: AccessCondition[];
  auditLog: AuditRequirement;
}
```

**Permission Matrix:**
- Buyers: Own data + available properties
- Developers: Own properties + buyer interactions
- Solicitors: Transaction documents + party communications
- Banks: Financial data + property valuations
- Government: Compliance data + fund tracking

## Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Core Integration
1. Property listing sync (Developer → Platform)
2. Buyer journey tracking (Platform → All parties)
3. Document workflow (All parties)
4. Payment processing (Buyer → Developer)

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
1. Real-time customization (Buyer ↔ Developer)
2. HTB integration (Buyer → Government → Developer)
3. Automated legal workflow (Solicitors ↔ Platform)
4. Construction updates (Developer → Buyer)

### Phase 3: Optimization
1. AI-powered matching (Buyer preferences → Properties)
2. Predictive analytics (Sales funnel optimization)
3. Automated compliance (Regulatory reporting)
4. Smart contracts (Milestone-based payments)

## Success Metrics

1. **User Experience:**
   - Time to complete journey
   - Number of touchpoints
   - User satisfaction scores
   - Error/retry rates

2. **Operational Efficiency:**
   - Document processing time
