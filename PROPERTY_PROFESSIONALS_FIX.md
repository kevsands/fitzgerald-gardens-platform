# Property Professionals Page Fix

## Issue
The page at `/solutions/property-professionals` was not loading correctly, showing a 404 error.

## Root Cause
1. Missing icon imports: `Building2` and `HardHat` were not imported from lucide-react
2. Incorrect icon name: `DraftingCompass` should be `Compass`  
3. TypeScript configuration issue requiring `allowSyntheticDefaultImports`

## Fixes Applied
1. Added `Building2` and `HardHat` to the imports
2. Changed `DraftingCompass` to `Compass` 
3. Added `allowSyntheticDefaultImports: true` to tsconfig.json
4. Restarted the development server

## Verification
✅ Page now returns HTTP 200
✅ All imports are correct
✅ TypeScript configuration is working

## How to Access
Visit: http://localhost:3000/solutions/property-professionals

The page is now working correctly and should display the Property Service Providers Platform interface.
